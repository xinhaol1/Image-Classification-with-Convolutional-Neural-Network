# Image-Classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This project creates and trains LeNet-5, a simple Convolutional Neural Network Architecture, with the training and testing dataset CIFAR-10 in the environment of Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda 3).
To run it, open it in Jupyter Notebook and run.
Prediction accuracy as the epoch increases is also plotted.
